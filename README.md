# Hi, I'm Kent 👋

Technical consultant. Startup founder (one exit). 15+ years solving problems where marketing and engineering collide.

> Most of my work lives behind NDAs, but here's what I'm up to publicly.

## 🔬 Current experiment

I'm documenting whether **SEO alone can build an audience in the age of AI** - tracking every metric, every frustration, every "why won't Google index this" moment.

## 💼 What I do

I run **GigTech LLC**, helping companies solve the messy intersection problems most consultants won't touch:

- SEO strategy blocked by technical debt
- Marketing teams that need infrastructure they don't know how to ask for
- Translating marketing jargon into things developers will actually fix

I can architect the strategy AND execute it. That's the difference.

## 🛠️ What I work with - ever changing

**Frameworks:** Astro, Next.js, Nuxt.js, WordPress, CakePHP

**Hosting:** Cloudflare, Netlify, Vercel, Cloudways, WPX

**Automation:** n8n, Clay.com, Claude Code

**Mail and Analytics:** GA4, GSC, SEMrush, Sanity

I'm framework-agnostic. I pick what fits the problem.

*Opinions are my own. Code is probably buggy. Golf swing is definitely buggy.*
