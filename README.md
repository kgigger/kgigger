# Hi, I'm Kent 👋

Developer, blogger, and professional tinkerer. I build things for clients by day and run weird experiments by night.

> Most of my work lives behind NDAs, but here's what I'm up to publicly.

## 🔬 Current experiment

I'm documenting whether **SEO alone can build an audience in the age of AI** - tracking every metric, every frustration, every "why won't Google index this" moment.

## 🛠️ What I work with

**Frameworks:** Astro, Next.js, Nuxt.js, WordPress, CakePHP

**Hosting:** Cloudflare, Netlify, Vercel, Cloudways, WPX

**Automation:** n8n, Clay.com, Claude Code

**Mail and Analytics:** GA4, GSC, SEMrush, Sanity

I'm framework-agnostic. I pick what fits the problem.

*Opinions are my own. Code is probably buggy. Golf swing is definitely buggy.*
